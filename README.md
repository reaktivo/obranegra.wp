# Obra Negra (GRAY00)

a project by Michael Ray-Von & Marcel Miranda (a component of the exhibition Building
on Ruins)

> The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine is a flexible timeline of semi-operational snapshots of a website’s states throughout its existence. Obra negra, gris, and blanca are concepts used in Mexico to designate the states of a building in construction. There is a tunnel in Playas de Tijuana that was meant to extend through a hill, but was abandoned mid-construction.

Obra Negra (GRAY00) is a web archive functioning as an alternate catalog, an expanded field, and an experiment in how the construction of the archive may manifest, resonate, and reoccur in the archive itself. As content is gathered (contributions alongside exhibition documentation), the website will accumulate 256 states of stylistic construction exhibited on a dynamically animate timeline. The construction will commence just prior to the opening of the exhibition and conclude with the closing.

Contributors are asked to submit **image, text, audio**, and/or **video** content that responds to, or develops on, the matters addressed in the exhibition. Subject matter may include, but is not limited to: construction, deconstruction, destruction, the archive, the catalog, the grayscale, linearity, non-linearity, heterogeneity, historiography, historicity, the wilderness, generation, regeneration, degeneration, eternal return, and so on. Contribution should be of a flexible relevancy and not become a matter of accuracy.

**We ask that contributions are delivered to [on@buildingon.ru](mailto:on@buildingon.ru)**  
**Obra Negra will be accessible at [http://buildingon.ru/ins](http://buildingon.ru/ins)**

## About *Building on Ruins*

**Building on Ruins** is a collective project investigating the multi-layered perspective from which we can conceive fabrication and collapse as part of the same project, and thus engage directly with the layering of history, like the jungle growing over temples and trash, or — more aptly — like building a temple with trash and planting trees on it. The exhibition’s works use a deconstructed architecture, framework, or system as a point of departure to build on top of, literally and/or figuratively, one’s personal relationship with the layering of history and the artistic impulse to build our own monuments on the problematic ground on which we stand. This willingness to acknowledge structural damage as part of the creative process can manifest resilience, indifference or cynicism. Nevertheless these works offer a sincere act of construction, an approach implying a different kind of detachment, not towards the art object but towards the energy invested in it, towards the futility of our faith in our own creation. Including a gallery exhibition, a series of readings and performances, and an expansive web-based project, Building on Ruins gathers works that address and accept the delusive nature of complete dedication to art making and commit to the dense, messy, all-over pattern of the political, economic, social and cultural issues it proposes to fulfill.
